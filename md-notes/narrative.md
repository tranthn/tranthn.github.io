## Introduction
Autoimmune diseases and cancer are both broad classes of disease with a high deal of diversity between and within them. However, both classes of disease cross in fundamental regulatory pathways, and this "cross-talk" can often result in one class of disease resulting in the other.

## Immune System Basics and Balance of its Effects
* immune system is body's defense against pathogens, comprises 2 main parts
	* innate: first line of body's defense against pathogens
		* always "patrolling" for pathogens, profiling in pathogens by broad groups
		* includes macrophages that ingest cells and natural killer (NK) cells, a first responder in fighting tumors
			* NK specifically can trigger downstream inflammatory responses via TNF-a
	* adaptive: the "specific" targeting arm of immune system
		* T cells: lymphocytes derived from thymus
		* B cells: highly diverse cells each with unique **antigen** receptors, release a specific **antibody** upon antigen recognition to fight pathogen

In a normal immune system, the components of the immune system have been "pre-screened" to not attack the regular functional tissues in an individual - the immune system is said to be tolerant of self. However, sometimes this system breaks down, and attacks itself, resulting in **autoimmune disease**.

## Commmonalties
### Hypoxia
Low oxygen conditions (**hypoxia**) are a common symptom in both autoimmune disease and cancer. In autoimmune disease, due to chronic immune response against self antigens, there is persistent inflammation of the affected system or tissue. In cancer, abnormally low levels of oxygen are often found in tumors and correlate with their level of malignancy by promoting angiogensis.

### Autoantibodies
Autoantibodies are antibodies that recognize self-tissue and are a common marker in both autoimmune disease and cancer. In some cases, the detection of the autoantibodies can be a realiable marker of an existing, and potentially asymptomatic tumor.

## Autoimmunity to Cancer


## Cancer to Autoimmunity
Sometimes in the course of the immune system's response to tumor (i.e. **neoplasm**) cells, it can go too far. Autoimmune diseases that manifest as a result of cancer are termed **paraneoplastic syndromes**.

POMA (paraneoplastic opsoclonus-myoclonus ataxia) is an example of a rare paraneoplastic neurological disorder that stems from some breast, ovarian, or lung cancers. In the course of generating antibodies against the cancer cells, the immune system ends up targeting a protein called NOVA-1, which is involved in splicing of a dopamine receptor pre-mRNA transcript. The result of this neurological attack leads to ataxia, or loss of controlled movements.
