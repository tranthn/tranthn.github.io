## Introduction
Autoimmune diseases and cancer are both broad classes of disease with a high deal of diversity between and within them. However, both classes of disease cross in fundamental regulatory pathways, and this "cross-talk" can often result in one class of disease resulting in the other.

## Immune System Basics and Balance of its Effects
* immune system is body's defense against pathogens, comprises 2 main parts
	* innate: first line of body's defense against pathogens
		* always "patrolling" for pathogens, profiling in pathogens by broad groups
		* includes macrophages that ingest cells and natural killer (NK) cells, a first responder in fighting tumors
			* NK specifically can trigger downstream inflammatory responses via TNF-a
	* adaptive: the "specific" targeting arm of immune system
		* T cells: lymphocytes derived from thymus
		* B cells: highly diverse cells each with unique antigen receptors, release antibodies upon antigen recognition to fight pathogen

In a normal immune system, the components of the immune system have been "pre-screened" to not attack the regular functional tissues in an individual - the immune system is said to be tolerant of self. However, sometimes this system breaks down, and attacks itself, resulting in *autoimmune disease*.
