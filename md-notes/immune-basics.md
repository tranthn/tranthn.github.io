### Components* immune system is body's defense against pathogens, comprises 2 main parts	* innate: first line of body's defense against pathogens		* always present, differentiates against groups of pathogens		* e.g. macrophages, which are phagocytes that ingest cells		* NK: natural killer cells that derive from lymphocytes, are non-specific 			* can kill some tumor cells or virus-infected cells	* adaptive: the highly "specific" targeting arm of immune system, diverse lymphocytes		* T cells: lymphocytes derived from thymus		* B cells: has specific antigen receptors, secretes Ab based on antigen-recognition#### Key Terms|term|definition||-----|-----||cytokine | proteins made by cells to affect behavior of other cells|| IL: interleukin | cytokine derived from lymphocytes || IFN: interferon | cytokine that can induce cells to resist viral replication - IFN-ɣ released by Th/Tc/NK cells || CD: cluster of differentiation | markers (proteins) expressed in cell to different cell lines, CD4/CD8 are common for helper T (Th) and cytotoxic (Tc) cells || autoimmune disease | when body uses B cells/Ab against normal, healthy self-cells. B/T cells that target self-antigens are (typically) screened-out/undergo apoptosis before maturation || inflammation | localized accumulation of fluids (swelling) and white blood cells during injury/infectio n/immune response - chronic inflammation is common marker of autoimmune disease |
