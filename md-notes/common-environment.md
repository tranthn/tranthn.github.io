### Immune System And Cancer: At a glance
* inflammation is a common symptom of autoimmune diseases, which can result in hypoxia
* hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) that manifest during hypoxic conditions promote angiogenesis
* immune system's proliferative/anti-proliferative effects
	* immune system can suppress cancer by: 
		* eliminating viruses, thus viral-tumors
		* stopping the root causes of inflammation, such as pathogens
		* targeting tumor cells, via tumor-associated antigens (TAA)
