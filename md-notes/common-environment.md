### Immune System And Cancer: At a glance
* inflammation is a common symptom of autoimmune diseases, which can result in hypoxia
* hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) that manifest during hypoxic conditions promote angiogenesis
* immune system's proliferative/anti-proliferative effects
* immune system can suppress cancer by: eliminate viruses (thus viral-tumors), stop causes of inflammation (e.g. pathogens), and targeting tumor cells (via tumor-associated antigens/TAA)
