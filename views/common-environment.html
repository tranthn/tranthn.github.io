<ul>
    <li>inflammation is a common symptom of autoimmune diseases, which can result in hypoxia</li>
    <li>hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) that manifest during hypoxic conditions promote angiogenesis</li>
    <li>immune system&#39;s proliferative/anti-proliferative effects</li>
    <li>immune system can suppress cancer by: eliminate viruses (thus viral-tumors), stop causes of inflammation (e.g. pathogens), and targeting tumor cells (via tumor-associated antigens/TAA)</li>
