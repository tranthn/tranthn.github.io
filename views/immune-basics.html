<li>immune system is body&#39;s defense against pathogens, comprises 2 main parts<ul>
<li>innate: first line of body&#39;s defense against pathogens<ul>
<li>always present, differentiates against groups of pathogens</li>
<li>e.g. macrophages, which are phagocytes that ingest cells</li>
<li>NK: natural killer cells that derive from lymphocytes, are non-specific <ul>
<li>can kill some tumor cells or virus-infected cells</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>adaptive: the highly &quot;specific&quot; targeting arm of immune system, diverse lymphocytes<ul>
<li>T cells: lymphocytes derived from thymus</li>
<li>B cells: has specific antigen receptors, secretes Ab based on antigen-recognition</li>

<td>IFN: interferon</td>
<td>cytokine that can induce cells to resist viral replication - IFN-É£ released by Th/Tc/NK cells</td>

<td>CD: cluster of differentiation</td>
<td>markers (proteins) expressed in cell to different cell lines, CD4/CD8 are common for helper T (Th) and cytotoxic (Tc) cells</td>

<td>autoimmune disease</td>
<td>when body uses B cells/Ab against normal, healthy self-cells. B/T cells that target self-antigens are (typically) screened-out/undergo apoptosis before maturation</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>inflammation</td>
<td>localized accumulation of fluids (swelling) and white blood cells during injury/infectio n/immune response - chronic inflammation is common marker of autoimmune disease</td>
