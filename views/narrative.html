<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Autoimmune diseases and cancer are both broad classes of disease with a great deal of diversity between and within them. However, both classes of disease cross in fundamental regulatory pathways and this &quot;cross-talk&quot; can often result in one class of disease resulting in the other.</p>

<ul>
    <li>The immune system is body&#39;s defense against pathogens. It comprises two main parts:
        <ul>
            <li>innate: first line of body&#39;s defense against pathogens
                <ul>
                    <li>always &quot;patrolling&quot; for pathogens, profiling in pathogens by broad groups</li>
                    <li>includes macrophages that ingest cells and natural killer (NK) cells, a first responder in fighting tumors
                        <ul>
                            <li>NK specifically can trigger downstream inflammatory responses via TNF-a</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>adaptive: the &quot;specific&quot; targeting arm of immune system
                <ul>
                    <li>T cells: lymphocytes derived from thymus, some major sub-types including cytotoxic, regulatory, or helpers T cells</li>
                    <li>B cells: highly diverse cells each with unique <strong>antigen</strong> receptors, release a <strong>antibody</strong> upon antigen recognition to fight a specific pathogen</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>cytokines: signaling proteins that modify the behavior of other cells, various cytkoines are released by innate and adaptive immune systems to regulate immune response</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>In a healthy immune system, the components of the immune system have been &quot;pre-screened&quot; to not attack the regular functional tissues in an individual - the immune system is said to be tolerant of self. However, sometimes this system breaks down and attacks itself, resulting in <strong>autoimmune disease</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="commonalties">Commonalties</h2>
<h3 id="inflammation-hypoxia">Inflammation and hypoxia</h3>
<p>Inflammation is hallmark of autoimmune disease as the innate immune system fights against itself. Chronic inflammation often results in low oxygen conditions (<strong>hypoxia</strong>). The combined effects of inflammation and hypoxia promote an increase in growth factors, cell proliferation, and hypoxia-compensating angiogensis. In cancer, abnormally low levels of oxygen are often observed in tumors and correlate with tumor malignancy by promoting angiogenesis.</p>

<h3 id="autoantibodies">Autoantibodies</h3>
<p>Autoantibodies are antibodies that recognize self-tissue and are a common marker in both autoimmune disease and cancer. In some cases, the detection of the autoantibodies can be a realiable marker of an existing, and potentially asymptomatic tumor.</p>
<hr>

<h2 id="autoimmunity-cancer">Autoimmunity to Cancer</h2>
<p>Inflammation is promoted by various cytokines released by the immune system, with pro-inflammatory cytokines promoting cell growth and proliferation. However, a side-effect is that any cells that sustained DNA damage are also bolstered by the microenvironment provided by chronic inflammation. </p>
<p>One of these pro-inflammatory cytokines is tumor necrosis factor alpha (<strong>TNF-α</strong>), which promotes transcription of immune-regulatory proteins. TNF-α released by macrophages during an immune response can stimulate cancer cells, which produce and respond to its own secretion of TNF-α and upregulating nearby macrophages. This continuous loop amplifies the effects of downstream growth signals, promoting tumor angiogenesis and development of gallbladder cancers.</p>

<h2 id="cancer-autoimmunity">Cancer to Autoimmunity</h2>
<p>Sometimes in the course of the immune system&#39;s response to tumor (i.e.<strong>neoplasm</strong>) cells, the immune response can go too far. Autoimmune diseases that manifest as a result of cancer are termed <strong>paraneoplastic syndromes</strong>.</p>
<p>POMA (paraneoplastic opsoclonus-myoclonus ataxia) is an example of a rare paraneoplastic neurological disorder that stems from some breast, ovarian, or lung cancers. In the course of generating antibodies against the cancer cells, the immune system ends up targeting a protein antigen responsible splicing of a dopamine receptor pre-mRNA transcript. The result of this neurological attack leads to ataxia, or loss of controlled movements.</p>

<h2 id="imbalance">An Acceptable Imbalance</h2>
<p>It&#39;s doubtful that developing cancer is ever a desired outcome - except maybe in an experimental settings. And it&#39;s difficult to imagine a case where developing an autoimmune disease is desired either, but what if it was necessary for effective treatment of cancer?</p>
<p>In the last couple decades, great headway has been made in immunotherapy to redirect the immune system against cancer cells. The treatment of melanoma is particularly remarkable - development of vitiligo (depigmentation of skin) in course of treating melanoma correlates with a better prognosis.</p>
<p>Ipilimumab is a treatment that inhibits the inhibitors of cytotoxic T (CD8) cells, there by promoting the immune system to kill melanocytes. Since the immune response is casting a wide net, melanocytes are killed indiscrminantly, reducing the skin&#39;s pigment.</p>
<p>Coming from another angle, vaccination for a targeted &quot;self&quot; antigen can induce both vitiligo <em>and</em> tumor destruction. As mentioned previously, immune system cells are pre-screened to prevent auto-immune reactions, but for self antigens highly expressed in tumor, breaking that immunity can be useful. Using a recombinant vaccina virus encoding a self antigen has shown effectiveness in recruiment of T cells and tumor cell destruction.</p>
